    <h2> <b> Engineer, Artist, Musician </b> </h2>
    <p> Parker graduated from Tufts University, Boston, in 2016, Majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Music Engineering. While at Tufts, he worked as a design engineer for RightHand Robotics, a company specialising in creating hightly skilled robotic arms.
      <br> In 2013-2014, Parker spent a year on an exchange at UCL in London, expanding his engineering horizons and outlook. In fact, Parker loved London so much that he will return to the city to complete his masters in September 2017. He will study an MArch in Design for Performance and Interaction at the Bartlett, UCL's prestigious school of architecture. </p> </br>

    <h3> Drip Bot </h3>
    <p> For this project, Parker teamed up with a programmer to engineer the creation of precise artworks through a seemingly unpredictable series of paint splashes. </p>

    <h2> Innovative machines and sounds <h2>
    <p> Passionate about music, Parker combines his love for kinetic machines and interesting sounds to create fantastical mobile objects that seem to have a life of their own. Alongside his machines, Parker also creates experimental music which he showcasts at events in Boston, in his hometown in Conneticut and soon, in London.</p>

    <h3> Opaque Projection </h3>
    <p> Here, Parker uses a 100-watt bulb to cook egs and melt ice, cubes, accompanied by the eerie, atmospheric efffects of a fan. </p>

    <h3> The Desk Instrument </h3>
    <p> Parker makes a music machine out of a desk, creating a machine that both calls upon physical interaction and sonic participation</p>
