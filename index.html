    <h2> Innovative machines and sounds <h2>
    <p> Passionate about music, Parker combines his love for kinetic machines and interesting sounds to create fantastical mobile objects that seem to have a life of their own. Alongside his machines, Parker also creates experimental music which he showcasts at events in Boston, in his hometown in Conneticut and soon, in London.</p>
